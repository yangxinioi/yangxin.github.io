  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Greetings! I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). My research focuses on two primary areas: neuromorphic vision perception and small object detection. Through my academic journey, I aim to harness advanced computational models to mimic and enhance human-like visual perception systems.</p>

  <h2>Research Interests</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Neuromorphic Vision Perception:</strong> Exploring bio-inspired algorithms and models for visual processing.</li>
    <li><strong>Small Object Detection:</strong> Developing robust techniques for detecting and analyzing small-scale objects in complex environments.</li>
    <li><strong>Biomedical Engineering Applications:</strong> Applying computer vision techniques in biomedical settings to address practical challenges.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Education</h2>
  <p><strong>Ph.D. Candidate in Biomedical Engineering,</strong> University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) 2024-</p>
  <p><strong>Master of Science (M.S.) in Software Engineering,</strong> University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan 2019-2023</p>
  <p><strong>Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Software Engineering,</strong> University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan 2015-2019</p>
